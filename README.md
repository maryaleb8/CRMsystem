# To start with

Run the command line: python3 otbor.py

# Functionality:
Admins have an opportunity to add new order to database with order status

# Technical details:

## back-end
In this project I use the REST-API architecture. In this API, there is an ability to add an order (/add_new_order), to change an order (/update_order), to delete an order (/delete_order). To view all orders from the database, I implemented /all_orders endpoint. (commands update and delete don't exist now)

## front-end
I made a convenient window for the administrator, with which you can easily add a new order.
